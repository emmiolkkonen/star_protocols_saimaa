## Analysis of population structure and genetic diversity in low-variance Saimaa ringed seals using low-coverage whole-genome sequence data
This repository contains code, instructions and a test dataset for replicating the analysis documented in the STAR protocols publication, originally described by LÃ¶ytynoja et al. (2023, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2023.01.040).

### Code
Notebooks containing the code for each step of the analysis are located in the directory [scripts/](./scripts/). For steps that include both R and bash, three notebooks are provided: one with R, one with bash and one python notebook containing the code for the entirety of the step.
